MInimum Spanning tree:
It is not necessary to have a cycle if all vertices are visited of a graph.
1.  HasPath:     TC: O(edges)or O(vertices^2)
    if two vertices have a path already then adding one more edge between them may create a cycle,
    so don't do it and get...
2. Union Find Algorithm:    TC:O(V) worst case
    Create a parent array for vertices and mark them all own with their own numeric values.

    Add an edge  to the tree, if the two vertices are of different components i.e they have different parent.

    if above condition is valid, then add the edge to the minimum Spanning tree and update either one of the 
    two vertices's topmost parent with the other vertices' topmost parent. 

MST is connected,acyclic and has minimum sum of weight of edges
