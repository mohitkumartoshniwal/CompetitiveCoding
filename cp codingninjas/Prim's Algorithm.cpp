/*

Given an undirected, connected and weighted graph G(V, E) with V number of vertices (which are numbered from 0 to V-1) and E number of edges.
Find and print the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm.
For printing MST follow the steps -
1. In one line, print an edge which is part of MST in the format -
v1 v2 w
where, v1 and v2 are the vertices of the edge which is included in MST and whose weight is w. And v1 <= v2 i.e. print the smaller vertex first while printing an edge.
2. Print V-1 edges in above format in different lines.
Note : Order of different edges doesn't matter.
Input Format :
Line 1: Two Integers V and E (separated by space)
Next E lines : Three integers ei, ej and wi, denoting that there exists an edge between vertex ei and vertex ej with weight wi (separated by space)
Output Format :
MST
Constraints :
2 <= V, E <= 10^5
Sample Input 1 :
4 4
0 1 3
0 3 5
1 2 1
2 3 8
Sample Output 1 :
1 2 1
0 1 3
0 3 5

Prim's algorithm is a greedy technique. Because we check for local mimnimum vertex in each iteration.

/*
Overall Time complexity is O(V^2)

1. It can be optimized if we use priority queue for getting minimum vertex O(logn)
2. And by using adjacency list to store and check neighbours of a particuar vertex 
   instead of searching all the vertice which is done in the code.

   Logic of one part of code has to be changed if priority queue is used

Hence if the input graph is represented using adjacency list, then the time complexity
 of Primâ€™s algorithm can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of binary heap.
