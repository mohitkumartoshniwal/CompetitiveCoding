/*
Given an undirected, connected and weighted graph G(V, E) with V number of vertices (which are numbered from 0 to V-1) and E number of edges.
Find and print the shortest distance from the source vertex (i.e. Vertex 0) to all other vertices (including source vertex also) using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Print the ith vertex number and the distance from source in one line separated by space. Print different vertices in different lines.
Note : Order of vertices in output doesn't matter.
Input Format :
Line 1: Two Integers V and E (separated by space)
Next E lines : Three integers ei, ej and wi, denoting that there exists an edge between vertex ei and vertex ej with weight wi (separated by space)
Output Format :
In different lines, ith vertex number and its distance from source (separated by space)
Constraints :
2 <= V, E <= 10^5
Sample Input 1 :
4 4
0 1 3
0 3 5
1 2 1
2 3 8
Sample Output 1 :
0 0
1 3
2 4
3 5

/*
Overall Time complexity is O(V^2)

1. It can be optimized if we use priority queue for getting minimum vertex O(logn)
2. And by using adjacency list to store and check neighbours of a particuar vertex 
   instead of searching all the vertice which is done in the code.

   Logic of one part of code has to be changed if priority queue is used

Hence if the input graph is represented using adjacency list, then the time complexity
 of Primâ€™s algorithm can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of binary heap.
