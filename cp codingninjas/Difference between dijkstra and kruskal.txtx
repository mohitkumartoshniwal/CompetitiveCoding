Dijkstra's algorithm will find the shortest path between two vertices.

Kruskal's algorithm will find the minimum spanning tree connecting all the given vertices.

Basically, Dijkstra's will find a connection between two vertices, while Kruskal's will find a connection 
between and number of vertices.
